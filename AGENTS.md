How to drive a VSS deployment from this repository, VSS CLI is the recommended approach to interact with a deployed VSS blueprint.

**Looking for a capability rather than the CLI?** [`skills/`](skills/) holds the
build, deploy and operational skills — deploy a profile, build a vision stack, search the archive,
ask about a video, manage alerts, generate a report. [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md)
lists them; each `SKILL.md` says when to use it and when not to.

Human contributor guidance — licensing, DCO, file headers — is in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). What the blueprint *is* is in
[README.md](README.md). Neither is repeated here.

## The `vss` CLI

### Setup

```bash
if ! command -v vss >/dev/null; then
  if [ -x /usr/local/bin/nemoclaw-start ]; then
    echo "Baked VSS CLI missing from the harness image" >&2; exit 1
  fi
  VSS_REPO_ROOT="${VSS_REPO_ROOT:-$HOME/video-search-and-summarization}"
  vss() { uv run --project "${VSS_REPO_ROOT}/services/agent" --no-dev --extra cli vss "$@"; }
fi
vss --version
```

The OpenClaw harness image already installs the pinned CLI at
`/usr/local/bin/vss` and exposes it through the `vss_cli` tool. Use that tool
or executable. Do not clone a repository or install dependencies in the sandbox.
If the baked executable is unavailable, report an image problem and stop.

The fallback function is for a development checkout without an installed CLI.
**`--extra cli` is required** there: without it the CLI is not installed and
there is no `vss` to run. **`--no-dev` matters too**: it is what keeps the
environment to the CLI's runtime — 256 MB with no `nvidia-nat` — where the
default group pulls the agent stack and 630 MB you have no use for.

Do not invoke it through `docker exec` or `kubectl exec`.

### No deployment yet?

The CLI talks to a **running** stack; it does not stand one up. If there is
nothing to configure against, report the missing deployment. An operation or
video question does not authorize deploying services. When deployment is requested:

[`/vss-build-vision-ai`](skills/vss-build-vision-ai/SKILL.md) takes the
capabilities you name — dense captioning, detection, search, alerting,
summarization — and composes, configures and deploys a stack for them, stock or
a custom combination. OR an industry profile, such as warehouse.

Then `vss configure --base-url <origin>` against what came up.

A partial deployment is normal and fine: `vss configure check` reports which
command groups it can serve, and the rest fail with exit 4 naming what is
missing rather than misbehaving.

### Point it at a deployment

Once per deployment. Nothing after this takes a host, port, or service URL.

```bash
vss configure --base-url "${VSS_PUBLIC_URL}"   # e.g. http://localhost:7777
vss configure show                              # what was recorded
vss configure check                             # re-probe + what each group can serve
```

`configure` probes the origin's ingress routes and writes `~/.vss/config.json`
(0600, no credentials). Re-run it after any deployment change.

**Never construct an endpoint.** No `kubectl port-forward`, no Service DNS, no
NodePort, no reading `HOST_IP` or `VST_INTERNAL_URL` out of a container. The CLI
reads no process env for endpoints by design, so the same input behaves the same
way on any host. A command that exits 4 saying a service is missing is fixed by
`vss configure`, not by a flag.

**An empty result is not a failure.** `{"count": 0}` at exit 0 means the
deployment genuinely has nothing matching; a backend problem exits 3. Never
treat the two as the same.

**Pipe carefully.** `vss … | jq` hides the CLI's exit code behind `jq`'s, so a
failed command with empty stdout reads as an empty answer. Use `set -o
pipefail`, or capture and check before piping.

### Rules

1. Configure once; never pass or construct an endpoint.
2. Branch on the exit code, not on parsing stdout for the word "error".
3. An empty result is an answer. Do not retry it as a failure.
4. Never fall back to raw REST when a command fails — report the failure. A
   hand-built query that returns *something* is worse than a clean failure,
   because nothing downstream can tell it was improvised.
5. Read identifiers from listings; never assemble one from a name.
6. Do not wrap commands in your own retry or timeout loops. Bounded waits are
   the CLI's job; a second layer hides which one gave up.
7. Cite the handle you were given — `media_url`, `job_id` — not one you rebuilt.
8. `run` blocks until the job finishes — synchronous by design. Background it
   for a long summarization: the record is written before the model call, so
   `vss summarize status --job-id <id>` answers while the run is still in
   flight, and `get` returns the summary once it lands. `vss summarize list`
   finds the id, which `run` itself only prints when it exits.

Per-command detail — sensor addressing, `--type`, window rules, what `vios`
covers and what it does not — is in
[`services/agent/packages/vss_cli/AGENTS.md`](services/agent/packages/vss_cli/AGENTS.md).

## Skills

Listed in [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md). A skill that talks to a
running deployment should drive `vss` and link here for the bootstrap, rather
than carrying its own copy.
